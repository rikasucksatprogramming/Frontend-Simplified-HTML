# Frontend-Simplified-HTML
I decided I should redo Frontend Simplified HTML course because they made a new version.
Also I kinda wanted to get better with HTML because I was going to be using it a lot in the future. The course has lead me to make a multi page website. It also showed me how to use multiple HTML functions. Lastly the course gave me a general run down on how HTML works and the general use. ALSO I'M DUMB
